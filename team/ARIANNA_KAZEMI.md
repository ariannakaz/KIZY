I am Arianna Kazemi, a senior Biochemistry and Informatics student at UMass Amherst. I am really interested in bioinformatics
and in using computing to make research better and easier. I have taken classes in JAVA, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
use python in my research into giant viruses. I have also done some web development in a project this summer.
